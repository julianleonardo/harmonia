  <div class="my-class">Few bands match the pastoral beauty and majesty of Harmonia, the short-lived German band that existed from 1973 to 1976. Harmonia was a ‘Krautrock’ supergroup, bringing together Dieter Moebius and Hans-Joachim Roedelius of Cluster, and Michael Rother of NEU!. Though Harmonia was not very well known during their lifetime in their native Germany, their music soon captured the attention of Brian Eno, David Bowie, and other highprofile admirers overseas.</div>

    <p><em>“This sounds romantic — it was like love at first sight. The two instruments we played together immediately clicked, and so I decided to put NEU! on hold. Roedelius and Moebius were equally excited about the idea of the three of us working together and so six weeks later, I left Düsseldorf and NEU! behind and moved to Forst. That’s how Harmonia started.”</em> -<strong>Michael Rother</strong>   </p>

  <div class="column">
  <p><em>“I liked Harmonia because they represented to me all that I had been enjoying about German music in general: a spareness, a rigor, a sense of experiment,”</em> -<strong>Brian Eno</strong>.</p>
